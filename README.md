# DLquantification
Repository for researching deep learning approaches for quantification.

## HistNetQ
HistNetQ implementation is based on pytorch. It is a neural network that focus on the quantification problem. It uses differentiable histograms in order to represent the samples.
All the relevant code for HistNet along with **instalation instructions** can found in the ˋdlquantificationˋ directory. Check the [README](histnet/README.md).

## Experiments
All the experimentation done with HistNetQ (or other DL approaches for quantification) lives in the folder ˋexperimentsˋ. You can check the corresponding documentation [here](experiments/paper/README.md)
